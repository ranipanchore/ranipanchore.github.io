          <h1>A hands on experience on web development and mobile development </h1>
          <p>
        I have experience for web development, this might include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Angular and backend technologies like Node.js. I am probably adept at building responsive websites, ensuring cross-browser compatibility, and optimizing performance. On the mobile side, I likely work with frameworks such as Ionic, or native development for Android and iOS. I have experience deploying apps, handling databases, and integrating APIs for a seamless user experience.
